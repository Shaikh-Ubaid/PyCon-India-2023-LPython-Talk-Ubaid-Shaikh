\section{Summary and Future Work}
    \begin{frame}{Summary}
        The compiler itself
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Implemented in C++
            \item Compiles in ~30s
            \item Fast compilation
            \item Fast runtime
            \item Custom AST/ASR tree representation and visitors
            \item Quickly loads and runs in a webpage
            \item \href{https://dev.lpython.org/}{https://dev.lpython.org/}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}
    
    \begin{frame}{Future Work}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item More complete NumPy support (arrays)
            \item Strong support for structs and pointers (allows general
            programming)
            \item Make sure LPython is at least as fast as C++ for every simple
            benchmark (currently we have a few where we are slower)
            \item Make ‘@pythoncall‘ work with the LLVM backend
            \item Allow to extend LPython with custom hardware backends
            (GPU, APU, ...)
            \item Use LPython for bigger projects (ML, compilers, etc.)
            \item Optimizations
        \end{itemize}
